### Criteria

<br>

<img src="fig_criteria.jpg" width="80%">

<br>

<br>

<u>1. Set the minimum likelihood ratio (LR) for the autosomal STR.</u>

* When the LR for a victim-reference pair is larger than the threshold, the victim-reference pair is estimated to be the assumed relationship.

* Click [here](#sec5-1) for more information.

<u>2. Set criteria for the Y-STR.</u>

* The victim-reference pair that satisfies all criteria is estimated to be the paternal lineage.

* Click [here](#sec5-1) for more information.

<u>3. Set criteria for the mtDNA.</u>

* The victim-reference pair that satisfies all criteria is estimated to be the maternal lineage.

* Click [here](#sec5-1) for more information.

<u>4. Update default to current settings.</u>

### Relationships

<br>

<br>

<br>

<u>1. Information on the defined relationships.</u>

* Parent-child, sibling, uncle-nephew (2nd-degree relative), and cousin (3rd-degree relative) are defined as defaults.

* The factor affecting the calculation is the IBD probabilities. If the IBD probabilities of the assumed victim-reference relationship are not on the default list, the relationship should be defined.

the user needs to define the relationship with IBD probabilities not on the default list.

<u>2. Edit the name of a defined relationship.</u>

* Select a defined relationship and enter a new name. Then press the "Edit" button.

<u>3. Delete a relationship.</u>

* Select a defined relationship and press the "Delete" button.

<u>4. Define a new relationship.</u>

* Enter the name of a defined relationship and set a family tree to define the victim-reference relationship.

* Click [here](#sec4-2-2) for more information on setting a family tree.

<u>5. Display a family tree.</u>

* Click [here](#sec4-2-2) for more information.

<u>6. Reset all defined relationships to default.</u>

<u>7. Update default to current settings.</u>

#### Set a family tree

When defining a new relationship between the victim and the reference, the user needs to set the family tree manually. For example, the grandparent-grandchild relationship can be defined as follows.

<br>

**Note**

* In regard to each person, information on the sex, father, and mother are required.

* If the person is a founder of the family tree, "Founder" needs to be set to "Yes".

* Persons other than the victim and the reference can be added by pressing the **"Add a person"** button.

* Persons other than the victim and the reference can be deleted by pressing the **"Delete a person"** button.

* The user can check the family tree. Press the **"View family tree"** button and then the family tree is displayed. An error message pops up when the setting of the family tree is inappropriate.

* When registering the defined relationship, press the **"Set"** button. An error message pops up when the setting of the family tree is inappropriate.

### Mutation rates

<br>

<br>

<br>

<u>1. Information on the mutation rates.</u>

<u>2. Edit a mutation rate.</u>

* Select a locus and enter a mutation rate. Then press the **"Edit"** button.

<u>3. Add a mutation rate.</u>

* Enter a locus name and a mutation rate. Then press the **"Add"** button.

<u>4. Delete a mutation rate.</u>

* Select a locus and press the **"Delete"** button.

<u>5. Reset all mutation rates to default.</u>

<u>6. Update default to current settings.</u>
