  abstract = {The introduction of forensic autosomal DNA profiles was controversial, but the problems were successfully addressed, and DNA profiling has gone on to revolutionise forensic science. Y-chromosome profiles are valuable when there is a mixture of male-source and female-source DNA, and interest centres on the identity of the male source(s) of the DNA. The problem of evaluating evidential weight is even more challenging for Y profiles than for autosomal profiles. Numerous approaches have been proposed, but they fail to deal adequately with the fact that men with matching Y-profiles are related in extended patrilineal clans, many of which may not be represented in available databases. The higher mutation rates of modern profiling kits have led to increased discriminatory power but they have also exacerbated the problem of fairly conveying evidential value. Because the relevant population is difficult to define, yet the number of matching relatives is fixed as population size varies, it is typically infeasible to derive population-based match probabilities relevant to a specific crime. We propose a conceptually simple solution, based on a simulation model and software to approximate the distribution of the number of males with a matching Y profile. We show that this distribution is robust to different values for the variance in reproductive success and the population growth rate. We also use importance sampling reweighting to derive the distribution of the number of matching males conditional on a database frequency, finding that this conditioning typically has only a modest impact. We illustrate the use of our approach to quantify the value of Y profile evidence for a court in a way that is both scientifically valid and easily comprehensible by a judge or juror.},

  abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is useful to assist with identification of the source of a biological sample, or to confirm matrilineal relatedness. Although the autosomal genome is much larger, mtDNA has an advantage for forensic applications of multiple copy number per cell, allowing better recovery of sequence information from degraded samples. In addition, biological samples such as fingernails, old bones, teeth and hair have mtDNA but little or no autosomal DNA. The relatively low mutation rate of the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) means that there can be large sets of matrilineal-related individuals sharing a common mitogenome. Here we present the mitolina simulation software that we use to describe the distribution of the number of mitogenomes in a population that match a given mitogenome, and investigate its dependence on population size and growth rate, and on a database count of the mitogenome. Further, we report on the distribution of the number of meioses separating pairs of individuals with matching mitogenome. Our results have important implications for assessing the weight of mtDNA profile evidence in forensic science, but mtDNA analysis has many non-human applications, for example in tracking the source of ivory. Our methods and software can also be used for simulations to help validate models of population history in human or non-human populations.},

If relationships are complex or if complicating factors like mutation, correction for population structure or silent alleles need to be accounted for, available software may fail. We present an explicit general formula for non-inbred pairwise cases. Equipped with this formula it is possible to evaluate, say, how strongly a shared rare allele, points towards a specific relationship. Moreover, a general expression as the one presented, adds to the understanding of models and the underlying biological mechanisms. It is also useful for checking software and defining the limitations of programs. Some ideas for improving software may also be generated by the derivation of exact expressions. We argue that a proportional mutation model is well suited from a pragmatic point of view and derive some theoretical properties of this model. Several examples based on the general pairwise formula and its implementation in the freely available R package mut are presented.},

Although this advancement provides improved discrimination power, the effects of linkage and mutation must be considered during kinship analysis. However, no software currently includes both of these effects. In this study, we developed new freeware called KinBN for kinship analysis based on a Bayesian network. The software is graphical-user-interface-based and calculates the likelihood ratios (LRs) at multiple loci considering the effects of linkage and mutation. In addition, the software can simulate the LR distribution according to the specified relationship. We confirmed the accuracy of KinBN by comparing its LRs with those of other software and evaluated the effects of linkage and mutation on the LRs. Our results indicate that KinBN is a useful tool for kinship analysis, particularly if expanded locus sets are used for DNA testing.}

  abstract = {In Europe, modern mitochondrial diversity is relatively homogeneous and suggests an ubiquitous rapid population growth since the Neolithic revolution. Similar patterns also have been observed in mitochondrial control region data in Finland, which contrasts with the distinctive autosomal and Y-chromosomal diversity among Finns. A different picture emerges from the 843 whole mitochondrial genomes from modern Finns analyzed here. Up to one third of the subhaplogroups can be considered as Finn-characteristic, i.e. rather common in Finland but virtually absent or rare elsewhere in Europe. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses suggest that most of these attributed Finnish lineages date back to around 3,000--5,000 years, coinciding with the arrival of Corded Ware culture and agriculture into Finland. Bayesian estimation of past effective population sizes reveals two differing demographic histories: 1) the `local' Finnish mtDNA haplotypes yielding small and dwindling size estimates for most of the past; and 2) the `immigrant' haplotypes showing growth typical of most European populations. The results based on the local diversity are more in line with that known about Finns from other studies, e.g., Y-chromosome analyses and archaeology findings. The mitochondrial gene pool thus may contain signals of local population history that cannot be readily deduced from the total diversity.},

  abstract = {Family studies can be used to measure the genetic distance between same-chromosome (syntenic) STRs in order to detect physical linkage or linkage disequilibrium. However, family studies are expensive and time consuming, in many cases uninformative, and lack a reliable means to infer the phase of the diplotypes obtained. HapMap provides a more comprehensive and fine-scale estimation of recombination rates using high density multi-point SNP data (average inter-SNP distance: 900 nucleotides). Data at this fine scale detects sub-kilobase genetic distances across the whole recombining human genome. We have used the most recent HapMap SNP data release 22 to measure and compare genetic distances, and by inference fine-scale recombination rates, between 29 syntenic STR pairs identified from 39 validated STRs currently available for forensic use. The 39 STRs comprise 23 core loci: SE33, Penta D \& E, 13 CODIS and 7 non-CODIS European Standard Set STRs, plus supplementary STRs in the recently released Promega CS-7™ and Qiagen Investigator HDplex™ kits. Also included were D9S1120, a marker we developed for forensic use unique to chromosome 9, and the novel D6S1043 component STR of SinoFiler™ (Applied Biosystems). The data collated provides reliable estimates of recombination rates between each STR pair, that can then be placed into haplotype frequency calculators for short pedigrees with multiple meiotic inputs and which just requires the addition of allele frequencies. This allows all current STR sets or their combinations to be used in supplemented paternity analyses without the need for further adjustment for physical linkage. The detailed analysis of recombination rates made for autosomal forensic STRs was extended to the more than 50 X chromosome STRs established or in development for complex kinship analyses.},

  abstract = {Background: Parentage testing laboratories may be asked to provide genetic evidence that two persons are or are not related, when no other relatives are available for study. Simple methods using autosomal, codominant, unlinked genetic systems can determine if two people are blood relatives (e.g., siblings). Study Design and Methods: The odds ratios (full sibship index) of true sibling pairs were determined from two-child paternity cases and compared with regionally and racially matched control pairs of unrelated children. The sharing of two, one, or no alleles was observed in pairs of children at three independent, polymorphic VNTR (variable number of tandem repeat) sequences loci. The sibship index was calculated as (the chance that an observation would occur if two children were siblings) divided by (the chance that it would occur if the two were unrelated). Sibship indices and the frequencies of shared alleles were determined for 20 sibling pairs and 20 control pairs. Results: Sibship index v  alues were less than 1 in all 20 pairs of unrelated children. Sibship index values were greater than 100 in nine pairs of siblings (45\%), between 10 and 100 in five pairs (25\%), between 1 and 10 in four pairs (20\%), and less than 1 in two pairs (10\%). Siblings shared two alleles in 17 of 60 observations (28.3\%); controls shared two alleles in 0 of 60 observations (0\%). Conclusion: The sharing of one allele and the sharing of no alleles at a polymorphic locus of high heterozygosity provide limited information for and against sibship, respectively. The sharing of two alleles produces strong evidence favoring sibship. In a given case, the study of more than three polymorphic loci of high heterozygosity may be needed to develop the evidence that two people are siblings. The general logic and methods used for siblings apply to kinship analyses of other two-person pedigrees.},
