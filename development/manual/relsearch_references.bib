  abstract = {The introduction of forensic autosomal DNA profiles was controversial, but the problems were successfully addressed, and DNA profiling has gone on to revolutionise forensic science. Y-chromosome profiles are valuable when there is a mixture of male-source and female-source DNA, and interest centres on the identity of the male source(s) of the DNA. The problem of evaluating evidential weight is even more challenging for Y profiles than for autosomal profiles. Numerous approaches have been proposed, but they fail to deal adequately with the fact that men with matching Y-profiles are related in extended patrilineal clans, many of which may not be represented in available databases. The higher mutation rates of modern profiling kits have led to increased discriminatory power but they have also exacerbated the problem of fairly conveying evidential value. Because the relevant population is difficult to define, yet the number of matching relatives is fixed as population size varies, it is typically infeasible to derive population-based match probabilities relevant to a specific crime. We propose a conceptually simple solution, based on a simulation model and software to approximate the distribution of the number of males with a matching Y profile. We show that this distribution is robust to different values for the variance in reproductive success and the population growth rate. We also use importance sampling reweighting to derive the distribution of the number of matching males conditional on a database frequency, finding that this conditioning typically has only a modest impact. We illustrate the use of our approach to quantify the value of Y profile evidence for a court in a way that is both scientifically valid and easily comprehensible by a judge or juror.},

  abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is useful to assist with identification of the source of a biological sample, or to confirm matrilineal relatedness. Although the autosomal genome is much larger, mtDNA has an advantage for forensic applications of multiple copy number per cell, allowing better recovery of sequence information from degraded samples. In addition, biological samples such as fingernails, old bones, teeth and hair have mtDNA but little or no autosomal DNA. The relatively low mutation rate of the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) means that there can be large sets of matrilineal-related individuals sharing a common mitogenome. Here we present the mitolina simulation software that we use to describe the distribution of the number of mitogenomes in a population that match a given mitogenome, and investigate its dependence on population size and growth rate, and on a database count of the mitogenome. Further, we report on the distribution of the number of meioses separating pairs of individuals with matching mitogenome. Our results have important implications for assessing the weight of mtDNA profile evidence in forensic science, but mtDNA analysis has many non-human applications, for example in tracking the source of ivory. Our methods and software can also be used for simulations to help validate models of population history in human or non-human populations.},

Typical examples include cases where DNA profiles are available from a burial site, a plane crash or a database of convicted offenders. The task is to determine the relationships between DNA profiles or individuals. Our approach generalises previous methods and implementations in several respects. We model general, possibly inbred, pairwise relationships which is important for non-human applications and in archaeological studies of ancient inbred populations. Furthermore, we do not restrict attention to autosomal markers. Some cases, such as distinguishing between maternal and paternal half siblings, can be solved using X-chromosomal markers. When many tests are done, the risk of errors increases. We address this problem by building on the theory of multiple testing and show how optimal thresholds for tests can be determined. We point out that the likelihood ratios in a blind search may be dependent so multiple testing methods and interpretation need to account for this. In addition, we show how a Bayesian approach can be helpful. Our examples, using simulated and real data, demonstrate the practical importance of the methods and implementation is based on freely available software.},

We present an explicit general formula for non-inbred pairwise cases. Equipped with this formula it is possible to evaluate, say, how strongly a shared rare allele, points towards a specific relationship. Moreover, a general expression as the one presented, adds to the understanding of models and the underlying biological mechanisms. It is also useful for checking software and defining the limitations of programs. Some ideas for improving software may also be generated by the derivation of exact expressions. We argue that a proportional mutation model is well suited from a pragmatic point of view and derive some theoretical properties of this model.

  abstract = {There are several indirect database searching approaches to identify the potential source of a forensic biological sample. These DNA-based approaches are familial searching, Y-STR database searching, and investigative genetic genealogy (IGG). The first two strategies use forensic DNA databases managed by the government, and the latter uses databases managed by private citizens or companies. Each of these search strategies relies on DNA testing to identify relatives of the donor of the crime scene sample, provided such profiles reside in the DNA database(s). All three approaches have been successfully used to identify the donor of biological evidence, which assisted in solving criminal cases or identifying unknown human remains. This paper describes and compares these approaches in terms of genotyping technologies, searching methods, database structures, searching efficiency, data quality, data security, and costs, and raises some potential privacy and legal considerations for further discussion by stakeholders and scientists. Y-STR database searching and IGG are advantageous since they are able to assist in more cases than familial searching readily identifying distant relatives. In contrast, familial searching can be performed more readily with existing laboratory systems. Every country or state may have its own unique economic, technical, cultural, and legal considerations and should decide the best approach(es) to fit those circumstances. Regardless of the approach, the ultimate goal should be the same: generate investigative leads and solve active and cold criminal cases to public safety, under stringent policies and security practices designed to protect the privacy of its citizenry.},

Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) based on DNA data from presumed relatives of the missing persons can be considered to be a collection of relationship problems. Forensic calculations in investigative mode address questions like ``How many markers and reference persons are needed?'' Such questions can be answered by simulations. Mutations, deviations from Hardy--Weinberg Equilibrium (or more generally, accounting for population substructure) and silent alleles cannot be ignored when evaluating forensic evidence in case work. With the advent of new markers, so called microvariants have become more common. Previous mutation models are no longer appropriate and a new model is proposed. This paper describes methods designed to deal with DVI problems and a new simulation model to study distribution of likelihoods. There are softwares available, addressing similar problems. However, for some problems including DVI, we are not aware of freely available validated software. The Familias software has long been widely used by forensic laboratories worldwide to compute likelihoods in relationship scenarios, though previous versions have lacked desired functionality, such as the above mentioned. The extensions as well as some other novel features have been implemented in the new version, freely available at www.familias.no.

A large proportion of the Y-STR profiles in the database were generated using either the Applied Biosystems Yfilerۛ or Yfilerۛ Plus PCR Amplification kits. The additional loci in the Yfiler Plus kit as compared to the Yfiler kit results in a concomitant cumulative mutation rate increase across the loci. Therefore, in those cases when two profiles have one to a few mismatched loci, it is difficult to determine if they are from the same lineage. In this study, 7405 unrelated male profiles were manually selected from the database. Analysis showed higher power of discrimination than the corresponding Yfiler haplotypes. Further, the distributions of the number of mismatched loci and the mismatched steps were generated for father-son, grandfather-grandson, uncle-nephew, and cousins (i.e. one, two, three, and four meioses, respectively) by exhaustive pairwise comparison of the unrelated profiles using a dynamic programming approach. The same distributions were generated for unrelated pairs with mutation rates of the loci. With the distributions, the false negative and false positive rates were determined.

  abstract = {In Europe, modern mitochondrial diversity is relatively homogeneous and suggests an ubiquitous rapid population growth since the Neolithic revolution. Similar patterns also have been observed in mitochondrial control region data in Finland, which contrasts with the distinctive autosomal and Y-chromosomal diversity among Finns. A different picture emerges from the 843 whole mitochondrial genomes from modern Finns analyzed here. Up to one third of the subhaplogroups can be considered as Finn-characteristic, i.e. rather common in Finland but virtually absent or rare elsewhere in Europe. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses suggest that most of these attributed Finnish lineages date back to around 3,000--5,000 years, coinciding with the arrival of Corded Ware culture and agriculture into Finland. Bayesian estimation of past effective population sizes reveals two differing demographic histories: 1) the `local' Finnish mtDNA haplotypes yielding small and dwindling size estimates for most of the past; and 2) the `immigrant' haplotypes showing growth typical of most European populations. The results based on the local diversity are more in line with that known about Finns from other studies, e.g., Y-chromosome analyses and archaeology findings. The mitochondrial gene pool thus may contain signals of local population history that cannot be readily deduced from the total diversity.},

  abstract = {Family studies can be used to measure the genetic distance between same-chromosome (syntenic) STRs in order to detect physical linkage or linkage disequilibrium. However, family studies are expensive and time consuming, in many cases uninformative, and lack a reliable means to infer the phase of the diplotypes obtained. HapMap provides a more comprehensive and fine-scale estimation of recombination rates using high density multi-point SNP data (average inter-SNP distance: 900 nucleotides). Data at this fine scale detects sub-kilobase genetic distances across the whole recombining human genome. We have used the most recent HapMap SNP data release 22 to measure and compare genetic distances, and by inference fine-scale recombination rates, between 29 syntenic STR pairs identified from 39 validated STRs currently available for forensic use. The 39 STRs comprise 23 core loci: SE33, Penta D \& E, 13 CODIS and 7 non-CODIS European Standard Set STRs, plus supplementary STRs in the recently released Promega CS-7™ and Qiagen Investigator HDplex™ kits. Also included were D9S1120, a marker we developed for forensic use unique to chromosome 9, and the novel D6S1043 component STR of SinoFiler™ (Applied Biosystems). The data collated provides reliable estimates of recombination rates between each STR pair, that can then be placed into haplotype frequency calculators for short pedigrees with multiple meiotic inputs and which just requires the addition of allele frequencies. This allows all current STR sets or their combinations to be used in supplemented paternity analyses without the need for further adjustment for physical linkage. The detailed analysis of recombination rates made for autosomal forensic STRs was extended to the more than 50 X chromosome STRs established or in development for complex kinship analyses.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the use of DNA data for personal identification has become a crucial feature for forensic applications such as disaster victim identification (DVI). Computational methods to cope with these kinds of problems must be designed to handle large scale events with a high number of victims, obtaining likelihood ratios and posterior odds with respect to different identification hypotheses. Trying to minimize identification error rates (i.e., false negatives and false positives), a number of computational methods, based either on the choice between alternative mutation models or on the adoption of a different strategy, are proposed and evaluated. Using simulation of DNA profiles, our goal is to suggest which is the most appropriate way to address likelihood ratio computation in DVI cases, especially to be able to efficiently deal with complicating issues such as mutations or null alleles, considering that data about these latter are limited and fragmentary.},

  abstract = {Disaster victim identification (DVI) can be aided by DNA-evidence, by comparing the DNA-profiles of unidentified individuals with those of surviving relatives. The DNA-evidence is used optimally when such a comparison is done by calculating the appropriate likelihood ratios. Though conceptually simple, the calculations can be quite involved, especially with large pedigrees, precise mutation models etc. In this article we describe a series of test cases designed to check if software designed to calculate such likelihood ratios computes them correctly. The cases include both simple and more complicated pedigrees, among which inbred ones. We show how to calculate the likelihood ratio numerically and algebraically, including a general mutation model and possibility of allelic dropout. In Appendix A we show how to derive such algebraic expressions mathematically. We have set up these cases to validate new software, called Bonaparte, which performs pedigree likelihood ratio calculations in a DVI context. Bonaparte has been developed by SNN Nijmegen (The Netherlands) for the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI). It is available free of charge for non-commercial purposes (see www.dnadvi.nl for details). Commercial licenses can also be obtained. The software uses Bayesian networks and the junction tree algorithm to perform its calculations.},

The conventional system exhibits insufficient estimation for kinship analysis such as sibship testing because of shortness of examined loci. This study evaluated the power of the PowerPlex Fusion System, GlobalFiler Kit, and PowerPlex 21 System, which comprise more than 20 autosomal STR loci, to estimate pairwise blood relatedness (i.e., parent-child, full siblings, second-degree relatives, and first cousins). The genotypes of all 24 STR loci in 10,000 putative pedigrees were constructed by simulation. The likelihood ratio for each locus was calculated from joint probabilities for relatives and non-relatives. The combined likelihood ratio was calculated according to the product rule. The addition of STR loci improved separation between relatives and non-relatives. However, these systems were less effectively extended to the inference for first cousins. In conclusion, these advanced systems will be useful in forensic personal identification, especially in the evaluation of full siblings and second-degree relatives. Moreover, the additional loci may give rise to two major issues of more frequent mutational events and several pairs of linked loci on the same chromosome.},

  abstract = {The Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI), together with SNN at Radboud University Nijmegen, have developed new software for pedigree matching which can handle autosomal, Y chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA profiles. Initially this software, called Bonaparte, has been developed for DNA DVI. Bonaparte has been successfully applied in a real DVI case: the Afriqiyah Airways crash in Tripoli, Libya on 12 May 2010 in which 103 persons perished. The software performed excellently in terms of computational performance, stability and user-friendliness. This showed that Bonaparte is a reliable and time-saving tool which significantly simplifies and enhances a large-scale victim identification process. Bonaparte has been applied in NFIs missing persons program. For this, the software is connected to the NFI's missing persons database (CODIS). Since Bonaparte uses XML as import format, data from any source can be imported. In the new configuration, CODIS data is automatically imported into Bonaparte. Then the software automatically performs a set of direct searches, as well as searches against both partial and full family trees. For the autosomal DNA results, exact likelihood ratios are computed. Finally, match reports can be generated on demand by Bonaparte's customized reporting modules. In this way, an advanced search strategy combined with a modern, efficient work flow is realized in NFI's missing persons program.},

This study provides data of Y-chromosomal haplotypes for 25 Y-STR markers, including six RM Y-STR markers (DYS576, DYS627, DYS518, DYS570, DYS449 and DYF387S1) typed with the Yfiler™ Plus kit in 1299 males of the Japanese population. Discrimination capacity increased from 87.2\% for 16 Y-STR markers with the Yfiler™ kit to 99.6\% for 25 Y-STR markers with the Yfiler™ Plus kit. We characterized sequences of observed microvariant alleles of eight Y-STR markers and a low-amplified allele of DYS390 by Sanger sequencing. DYF387S1, a multi-locus Y-STR marker that is located at two positions on the human Y-chromosome, was observed in tri-allelic patterns in 51 of 1299 samples (3.9\%) and we found an extremely high frequency of the tri-allelic pattern of DYF387S1 in haplogroup C-M131. We also analyzed Y-STR gene diversity in each haplogroup and its relevance to mutation rates.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parentage testing laboratories may be asked to provide genetic evidence that two persons are or are not related, when no other relatives are available for study. Simple methods using autosomal, codominant, unlinked genetic systems can determine if two people are blood relatives (e.g., siblings). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The odds ratios (full sibship index) of true sibling pairs were determined from two-child paternity cases and compared with regionally and racially matched control pairs of unrelated children. The sharing of two, one, or no alleles was observed in pairs of children at three independent, polymorphic VNTR (variable number of tandem repeat) sequences loci. The sibship index was calculated as (the chance that an observation would occur if two children were siblings) divided by (the chance that it would occur if the two were unrelated). Sibship indices and the frequencies of shared alleles were determined for 20 sibling pairs and 20 control pairs. RESULTS: Sibship index values were less than 1 in all 20 pairs of unrelated children. Sibship index values were greater than 100 in nine pairs of siblings (45\%), between 10 and 100 in five pairs (25\%), between 1 and 10 in four pairs (20\%), and less than 1 in two pairs (10\%). Siblings shared two alleles in 17 of 60 observations (28.3\%); controls shared two alleles in 0 of 60 observations (0\%). CONCLUSION: The sharing of one allele and the sharing of no alleles at a polymorphic locus of high heterozygosity provide limited information for and against sibship, respectively. The sharing of two alleles produces strong evidence favoring sibship. In a given case, the study of more than three polymorphic loci of high heterozygosity may be needed to develop the evidence that two people are siblings. The general logic and methods used for siblings apply to kinship analyses of other two-person pedigrees.},
